# Moe
Advanced content uploading tool.
## Usage

### Resources
There's a fully commented moerc file you can use to create your own.

### Build

    $ git clone https://github.com/Imakethings/Moe
    $ cd Moe
    $ ./INSTALL clone # sh INSTALL clone

In the future you can `git pull` this repository and run `./INSTALL update`
to update all the files (this will overwrite your moerc file).

This will create the binary `/usr/local/bin/moe`.

### Run
    $ moe

### Manual
    $ man moe
